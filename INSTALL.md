```
- or use github desktop to clone the retrobat-setup repository

3) Download RetroBuild here: https://github.com/Tartifless/retrobat-build/releases and extract it in the retrobat-setup folder

4) Open the build.ini file with your favorite text editor to define build options

5) Run RetroBuild.exe to build RetroBat

6) Run option 1 first and wait until the process is finished
